[03:05pm][(kryocera)] like, if I type '/msg S' in BitchX, that completes out,
                      but if i type in '/im Scew' it doesnt complete

[katsumi(~katsumi@homercles.ma.ultranet.com)(04:11pm)] I am not sure if it
          would be difficult to do, but I think it would be usefull to make
          incoming messages 'beep' the terminal

[spinergy(spin@god.damn-the-man.net)(12:53pm)] btw, some features I would like
          to see added. (or maybe you can tell me they are already here). I
          would like to be able to do '/window new im <user>' so all im's to
          and from <user> end up on that window.

[spinergy(spin@god.damn-the-man.net)(12:53pm)] it would also be nice to be
          able to specify a window for all other aim messages to go to 'window
          new aim' maybe?
